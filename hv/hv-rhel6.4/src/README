Please use the following steps to compile and install the Hyper-V backup 
components in a RHEL 6.4 virtual machine:


a) Run the script vss-hv-driver-install as a root user to build 
and install the Hyper-V backup driver on a RHEL 6.4 virtual machine.
# ./vss-hv-driver-install


b) Once the driver is installed, change directory to tools/ directory 
and compile the Hyper-V backup daemon as follows:
# gcc â€“o hv_vss_daemon hv_vss_daemon.c


c) Copy the Hyper-V backup daemon in the init.d directory of your RHEL 5.9 installation to start it
at boot time by default.


Please use the following steps to uninstall the Hyper-V backup components.


a) Run the following script:


# ./vss-hv-driver-uninstall


Once the script completes, reboot the machine
to bringup RHEL5 without Hyper-V backup driver. 


b) Remove the Hyper-V backup daemon from init.d directory.
